# Examples

This directory contains several examples that show how the appenders are configured:

* [log4j1-example](log4j1-example): writes logging messages to each of the destinations.

Each example contains its own README that goes into further detail on its operation.

In addition, there are [CloudFormation templates](cloudformation) to create the destinations
used by these examples.
